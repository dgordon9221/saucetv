            <h3 class="mod-text">DawgILY</h3>
            <p>How do you describe Dawg, he's simply Dawg.  Well known for his wonderful collaboration streams with LeySauce, Dawg is also Dale's definitely real fiancé, they're in love I swear.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mod-row">
            <img class="headshot" src="images/diddly.png" alt="computer">

            <p>Diddly is one of our Canadian mods, from the great land of Manitoba (aka fuck it's cold).  He may need an inhaler to survive making love, but his wrist shot is a guaranteed bardown.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mod-row">
            <img class="headshot" src="images/beal.png" alt="computer">
            <h3 class="mod-text">Eye_Beal</h3>
            <p>Beal is one of the oldest moderators in the channel.  While he's not around as much anymore, whenever he stops by it's a welcome sight.  Also his real name is not actually Conrad Cole.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mod-row">
            <img class="headshot" src="images/felix.gif" alt="computer">

        </div>
        <div class="mod-row">
            <img class="headshot" src="images/centrist.png" alt="computer">
            <h3 class="mod-text">FlamingCentrist</h3>
            <p>Flaming is always down to Peppa Pig the stream.  He walks a little funny given his flat left foot, but he's always a welcome sight to see in the chat logs.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mod-row">
            <img class="headshot" src="images/heck.png" alt="computer">
            <h3 class="mod-text">Heck_Yeah1</h3>
            <p>Heck_Yeah won mod off a game of marbles on stream.  They are one of the quietest mods, preferring mostly to hide in the shadows, but you never know when they're lurking around the corner.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mod-row">
            <img class="headshot" src="images/jamsapp.png" alt="computer">
            <h3 class="mod-text">jamsapp</h3>
            <p>Jam is truly able to do incredible things.  Whether it be to help the stream, or simply to restore a vintage motorcycle from a box of parts, they can do it all (okay maybe that's not simple).</p>
        </div>

            <p>"I've got nothing" - jimhikingjacket when asked for a fun fact.  In reality, he's been a long standing member of the community, well known for his strong political leanings, he's our Kkomrade.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mod-row">
            <img class="headshot" src="images/kait.png" alt="computer">
            <h3 class="mod-text">kaituwu</h3>
            <p>A drunken addition to the mod staff, Kait improves the quality of every chat she's in.  She was also pushed down a flight of stairs when she was 3, so take from that what you will.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mod-row">
            <img class="headshot" src="images/kurlz.png" alt="computer">
            <h3 class="mod-text">Kingkurlz</h3>
            <p>Kingkurlz is the longest standing sub in the channel, need I say more?  He found LeySauce through a raid from fellow mod Beal, and has been a critical part of the stream ever since.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mod-row">
            <img class="headshot" src="images/malk.png" alt="computer">
            <h3 class="mod-text">Malkierian</h3>
            <p>Malk, the true 5Head.  Malk is one of LeySauce's oldest and most trusted friends, and has helped set up a ton of the behind the scenes stuff to enable the stream and Discord to run smoothly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mod-row">
            <img class="headshot" src="images/moth.png" alt="computer">
            <h3 class="mod-text">mothpeach</h3>
            <p>Moth is a staple among the Mario community.  They sometimes have trouble typing, but every single time they're around you know you'll enjoy their presence.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mod-row">
            <img class="headshot" src="images/moose.png" alt="computer">
            <h3 class="mod-text">PensiveMoose</h3>
            <p>Moose is so hungry.  On a real note, Moose is an integral part of the stream.  He won mod of the year 2022 (and most toxic mod), and his Ninja Gaiden speedruns are top tier.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mod-row">
            <img class="headshot" src="images/siri.png" alt="computer">
            <h3 class="mod-text">siri_luna</h3>
            <p>Siri hails from the lovely country of Iceland, and would like everyone to live in fear of their 13 different Santas called the Yule Lads, the sons of a giant who terrorize everyone.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mod-row">
            <img class="headshot" src="images/ssj.png" alt="computer">
            <h3 class="mod-text">ssjzilla</h3>
            <p>As the resident Aussie mod, ssj is a key factor in keeping the stream under control when the rest of them need sleep.  Okay, that's a lie, they're all degenerates.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mod-row">
            <img class="headshot" src="images/luna.png" alt="computer">
            <h3 class="mod-text">StardewLuna</h3>
            <p>You can often find Luna chilling in the stream with her husband Nils and her adorable kitty Powder.  Luna's study of sociology leads her to be a fountain of knowledge.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mod-row">
            <img class="headshot" src="images/syfy.png" alt="computer">
            <h3 class="mod-text">SyFy64</h3>
            <p>SyFy64 is one of the longest standing mods in the stream as an IRL Friend of Brett.  He likes bourbon, and his moustache doesn't connect to his beard on the left side.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mod-row">
            <img class="headshot" src="images/queen.png" alt="computer">
            <h3 class="mod-text">thequeenrii</h3>
            <p>Queen is the definition of the word slay.  She came to LeySauce's channel a complete noob to speedrunning, and has come to learn a lot from her time.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mod-row">
            <img class="headshot" src="images/worst.png" alt="computer">
            <h3 class="mod-text">worstsamurai</h3>
            <p>Worst is an incredibly talented artist and amazing person in every channel.  Worst likes men, yugioh, and watching people play children's video games accompanied by an assortment of loud noises.</p>
